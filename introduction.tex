\section{Thesis Statement}

\paragraph{From PhD proposal}
A comprehensive approach that simultaneously considers and optimizes the optics, electronics, hardware, and software can lead to improved capabilities in near-eye displays.

% Andrew's thesis statement: 
% The use of a joint computational and optical approach to see-through near eye displays will allow displays to achieve higher performance, a new set of capabilities, and a different trade-offs as compared to purely optical approaches.


\paragraph{Alternative options}
\begin{compact_itemize}
\item The use of a computational displays approach, where the optics, electronics, and rendering pipeline are jointly designed, will allow displays to achieve higher performance for monocular depth cues.
