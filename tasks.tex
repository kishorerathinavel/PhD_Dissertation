\section{Notes from PhD progress update}
\begin{compact_itemize}
\item MS: You have some knobs (number of depth planes, color bit-depth, LED bit-depth, Lens function, DMD framerate, decomposition algorithm, depth cues, time to render and decompose); I want to see a design space analysis, trade-offs for the various parameters in the display
\item MS: Discuss various possible approaches for scene decomposition, various possibilities choices in the optimization regime. Solve for one particular case.
\item KR: Discuss how various other display technologies can be emulated by your display
\item KR: Compare your display against other similar recent displays. Can we prove that our display is better?
\item DL,GW: Not clear what you are optimizing. Is it the depth blur? Are there other things that you could optimize for? We need to see your current optimization effort and future ones written in a much more concrete and formalized manner. 
\item LM: Discuss artifacts that may be possible in a real-time display because the different depth planes have different update rates (e.g. planes in the middle have equally spaced update rates whereas planes at the far or near have different updates - one very short and one very long)
\item GW: Need to show convergence analysis to convince folks that your algorithm actually works
\item GW: Your current approach is called projected-gradient approach
\item DL,LM: Look into error diffusion. This is a known technique in computer graphics. What you need is something like 3D error diffusion or 3D dithering.
\item LM: You can redo a lot of perceptual experiment with this display. You're holding yourself back by not doing them. Such studies would be real contribution to science rather than engineering which is what most of your work is about.
\item TW, MS: Please share with us a block diagram of your real-time system

\section{Tasks}
\begin{compact_todolist}
\item Write down these algorithms for color-adaptive decomposition:
    \begin{compact_todolist}
    \item adaptive\_color\_decomposition
    \item adaptive\_color\_decomposition\_all\_channels
    \item heuristic\_adaptive\_decomposition
    \item highest\_energy\_channel\_decomposition
    \item ColorDC\_edit3
    \end{compact_todolist}
\item Things of note to write down for above algorithms:
    \begin{compact_todolist}
    \item Non-fixed pipeline algorithms tend to use more binary voxels, but tend to concentrate the energies in a narrow region. Maybe a threshold can be used to stop carrying over the residual energy. 
    \item Main gains are in terms of variance of binary voxel depths - which is an indication of depth blur. Is there a way to quantify this in terms of diopters?
    \item Single channel projected gradient algorithm is not necessary because the initialization is good enough. Further optimization never happens.
    \item Mixed-primary projected gradient algorihtm sucks. Main reason is that there is really not that much correspondence between the three color channels - this can be shown by counting the number of times the heuristic\_adaptive\_decomposition algorithm picks a mixed-primary combination, which is almost never. The bunny image is not a good example because it is not composed of mixed primaries. What about something with more complex colors - how do adaptive\_color\_decomposition\_all\_channels and heuristic\_adaptive\_decomposition do?
    \end{compact_todolist}
\item Include pictures to compare the four algorithms
\item Write code to calculate focal stacks
\item Make blockdiagram of the real-time system. Share it with the PhD committee
