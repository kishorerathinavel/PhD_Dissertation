\section{Literature on the importance of depth cues for AR displays}

\cite{sielhorst2008advanced} provide a good set of references on depth perception studies. \cite{sielhorst2008advanced} also provide a good summary of \cite{cutting1995perceiving} which in turn is a seminal paper about the different types of depth cues and their relative importance. The summary: Occlusion is the most important depth cue even though it is only an  because because it can only reveal the order but not a relative or absolute distance. \cite{sielhorst2008advanced} call it ``interposition''. \cite{sielhorst2008advanced}.
