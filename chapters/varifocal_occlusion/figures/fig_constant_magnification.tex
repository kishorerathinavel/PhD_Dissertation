\caption[Varifocal-Occlusion NED: Constant real-world magnification independent of virtual image plane distance]{View through our prototype occlusion-capable AR display for different settings of occlusion/virtual image plane depth with camera focus fixed on foreground. The user fixates the foreground objects (left) and background objects (right) and the virtual image distance and occlusion mask are following their fixation distance. The camera remains focused on the foreground object, demonstrating that changing optical settings of the display do not change the magnification of the physical scene, as indicated by the stamp's size. }
