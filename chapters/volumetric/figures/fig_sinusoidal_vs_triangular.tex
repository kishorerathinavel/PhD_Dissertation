\caption[Volumetric NED: Sinusoidal vs. triangular lens functions]{Images show the see-through view through the display when the optical power of the focus-tunable lens follows a triangular waveform and a sinusoidal waveform. For both these images, the voxelization and color volume to binary volume decomposition was performed assuming a triangular waveform. We don't observe a significant difference in the see-through images.}
