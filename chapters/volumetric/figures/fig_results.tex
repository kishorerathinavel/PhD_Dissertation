\caption[Volumetric NED: results]{View through our volumetric near-eye display where virtual objects are placed among real objects at a range of distances. \emph{Extreme left:} Overhead depiction of scene geometry. Icons to the left of the optical axis correspond to virtual objects, while icons to the right of the optical axis correspond to real objects. \emph{Other images, left to right, in each row:} Photos taken through the display where the focus of the camera is adjusted progressively from near to far. In each row, the only difference between the see-through views is the camera's focus settings - this demonstrates the ability of the display to provide proper focus cues for all virtual pixels simultaneously, allowing the viewer to freely accommodate in the scene without any feedback to the display.}
