\caption[Volumetric NED: optics overview]{Figure shows an overview of the hardware and operation of our NED. The NED is composed of a high-speed HDR LED, high-speed projector, focus-tunable lens, and other common optical components. The NED's optics, rendering pipeline, and the synchronized operation of its active components (HDR LEDs, DMD, focus-tunable lens) work together to present a color volume spanning 15 cm (6.7 diopters) to 400 cm (0.25 diopters).}
